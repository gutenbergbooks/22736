<p>DEDICATION</p>

<p>J'ÉCRIS POUR QUE LE JOUR OÙ JE NE SERAI PLUS</p>

<p>J'écris pour que le jour où je ne serai plus<br>
On sache comme l'air et le plaisir m'ont plu,<br>
Et que mon livre porte à la foule future<br>
Comme j'aimais la vie et l'heureuse nature.</p>

<p>Attentive aux travaux des champs et des maisons<br>
J'ai marqué chaque jour la forme des saisons,<br>
Parce que l'eau, la terre et la montante flamme<br>
En nul endroit ne sont si belles qu'en mon âme.</p>

<p>J'ai dit ce que j'ai vu et ce que j'ai senti,<br>
D'un coeur pour qui le vrai ne fut point trop hardi,<br>
Et j'ai eu cette ardeur, par l'amour intimée,<br>
Pour être après la mort parfois encore aimée,</p>

<p>Et qu'un jeune homme alors lisant ce que j'écris,<br>
Sentant par moi son coeur, ému, troublé, surpris,<br>
Ayant tout oublié des épouses réelles,<br>
M'accueille dans son âme et me préfère à elles.</p>

<p>The Inn of Dreams</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Laughter! Sweet Delight!<br>
My heart is like a lighted Inn that waits<br>
Your swift approach . . . and at the open gates<br>
White Beauty stands and listens like a flower.<br>
She has been dreaming of you in the night,<br>
O fairy Princes; and her eyes are bright.<br>
Spur your fleet horses, this is Beauty's hour!<br>
Even as when a golden flame up-curled<br>
Quivers and flickers out in a dark place,<br>
So is it with the flame of Beauty's face—<br>
That torch! that rose! that wonder of the world!<br>
And Love shall weep to see—when he rides by<br>
Years hence (the time shall seem as a bird's flight)—<br>
A lonely Inn beneath a winter sky.<br>
Come now, sweet friends! before the summer die.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sweet Laughter! Sweet Delight!</p>

<br>
<a name="3"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>The Kingdom of Heaven</p>

<p>O World that holds me by the wings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How shall my soul escape your snares?<br>
So dear are your delightful things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So difficult your toils and cares:<br>
That, every way my soul is held<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By bonds of love, and bonds of hate;<br>
With all its heavenly ardours quelled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And all its angels desolate . . .</p>

<p>Yet in the heart of every child,<br>
God and the world are reconciled! . . .</p>

<br>
<a name="4"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>A Dream</p>

<p>I dreamed we walked together, you and I,<br>
Along a white and lonely road, that went<br>
I know not where . . . and we were well content.<br>
Our laughter was untroubled as the sky,<br>
And all our talk was delicate and shy,<br>
Though in that cage of words wild thoughts were pent<br>
Like prisoned birds that some sweet accident<br>
Might yet release to sing again, and fly.<br>
We passed between long lines of poplar trees . . .<br>
Where, summer comrades gay and debonair,<br>
The south wind and the sunlight danced . . . you smiled,<br>
With great glad eyes, as bright as summer seas,<br>
To feel their twinkling fingers in your hair . .<br>
And then you kissed me, quickly, like a child!</p>

<br>
<a name="5"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>The Autumn Day</p>

<p>How delicately steps the autumn day<br>
In azure cloak and gown of ashen grey<br>
Over the level country that I love!</p>

<p>With glittering veils of light about her head<br>
And skirts of wide horizons round her spread<br>
White as the white wing-feathers of a dove.</p>

<p>Her feet, a flash of silver on the sea,<br>
Chase silver sails that fly untiringly<br>
Towards the enchanted Islands of the West.</p>

<p>Beautiful Islands, gardens of delight!<br>
That flower at dawn with roses red and white . . .<br>
And flame at sunset gold and amethyst . . .</p>

<p>How delicately steps the autumn day<br>
In azure cloak and gown of ashen grey<br>
Over the level country that I love . . .</p>

<p>And how my heart that all sweet things beguile<br>
Goes laughing with her for a little while . . .<br>
And then turns homeward like a weary dove.</p>

<br>
<a name="6"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Angels</p>

<p>When life is difficult, I dream<br>
Of how the angels dance in heaven!<br>
Of how the angels dance and sing<br>
In gardens of eternal spring,<br>
Because their sins have been forgiven . . .<br>
And never more for them shall be<br>
The terrors of mortality!<br>
When life is difficult, I dream<br>
Of how the angels dance in heaven . . .</p>

<br>
<a name="7"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>The Changeling</p>

<p>My father was a golden king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My mother was a shining queen;<br>
I heard the magic blue-bird sing . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
They wrapped me in a mantle green.</p>

<p>They led their winged white horses out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We rode and rode till dawn was grey;<br>
We rode with many a song and shout,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Over the hills and far away.&quot;</p>

<p>They stole the crying human child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And left me laughing by the fire;<br>
And that is why my heart is wild,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And all my life a long desire . . .</p>

<p>The old enchantments hold me still . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And sometimes in a waking trance<br>
I seek again the Fairy Hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The midnight feast, the glittering dance!</p>

<p>The wizard harpers play for me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wear a crown upon my head,<br>
A princess in eternity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I dance and revel with the dead . . .</p>

<p>&quot;Vain lies!&quot; I hear the people cry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I listen to their weary truth;<br>
Then turn again to fantasy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the untroubled Land of Youth.</p>

<p>I hear the laughter of the kings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I see their jewelled flagons gleam . . .<br>
O wine of Life! . . . immortal things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Move in the splendour of my dream . . .</p>

<p>My spirit is a homing dove . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I drain a crystal cup, and fall<br>
Softly into the arms of Love . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And then the darkness covers all.</p>

<br>

<br>
<br>

<p>A Song Against Care</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Care!<br>
Thou art a cloak too heavy to be borne,<br>
Glittering with tears, and gay with painted lies<br>
(For seldom—seldom art thou stained and torn,<br>
Showing a tattered lining, and the bare<br>
Bruised body of thy wearer); thou art fair<br>
To look at, O thou garment of our pride!<br>
A net of colours, thou dost catch the wise;<br>
He lays aside his wisdom for thy sake . . .<br>
And Beauty hides her loveliness in thee . . .<br>
And after . . . when men know the agony<br>
Of thy great weight of splendour, and would shake<br>
Thee swiftly from their shoulders, cast aside<br>
The burden of thy jewelled bands that break<br>
Their very hearts . . . often it is too late.<br>
They fear the world will mock them and deride<br>
When they are stripped of all their golden state.<br>
But some are brave . . . but some among us dare<br>
Cry out against thy torment and be free!<br>
And I would rather a gay beggar be,<br>
And go in rags for all eternity,<br>
Than that thy clanking pomp should cover me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
O Care! . . .</p>

<p>&quot;Quelque part une Enfance très douce doit mourir&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Albert Samian</p>

<p>Alas! I do not know on what sad day<br>
My childhood went away . . .<br>
It may have left me softly in the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I was sleeping—dreaming—who can tell?<br>
Perhaps it whispered &quot;wings were made for flight!&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I only know it never said &quot;farewell&quot; . . .</p>

<p>And so I cannot tell when youth will go<br>
Although I love it so . . . <br>
But like a little amorous girl that clings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To some fair boy, my spirit all afraid,<br>
While yet she holds youth back by the bright wings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Knows he must leave her for some other maid!</p>

<br>
<a name="10"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Candle-Light</p>

<p>Frail golden flowers that perish at a breath,<br>
Flickering points of honey-coloured flame,<br>
From sunset gardens of the moon you came,<br>
Pale flowers of passion . . . delicate flowers of death . . .</p>

<p>Blossoms of opal fire that raised on high<br>
Upon a hundred silver stems are seen<br>
Above the brilliant dance, or set between<br>
The brimming wine-cups . . . flowers of revelry!</p>

<p>Roses with amber petals that arise<br>
Out of the purple darkness of the night<br>
To deck the darkened house of Love, to light<br>
The laughing lips, the beautiful glad eyes.</p>

<p>Lilies with violet-coloured hearts that break<br>
In shining clusters round the silent dead,<br>
A diadem of stars at feet and head,<br>
The glory dazzles . . . but they do not wake . . .</p>

<p>O golden flowers the moon goes gathering<br>
In magic gardens of her fairy-land,<br>
While splendid angels of the sunset stand<br>
Watching in flaming circles wing to wing . . .</p>

<p>Frail golden flowers that perish at a breath,<br>
That wither in the hands of light, and die<br>
When bright dawn wakens in a silver sky.<br>
Pale flowers of passion . . . delicate flowers of death.</p>

<br>
<a name="11"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>In the South</p>

<p>I was pale and sad in the South like the olive-trees<br>
That droop their silver heads by the dusty roads,<br>
And are grave and cold and grey in spite of the sun . . .<br>
In the veils of rose and blue that the bright dawn spun<br>
Day wrapped me round in vain!<br>
I longed for the lovers and friends I had left behind,<br>
I longed for the North again.</p>

<p>I was deaf to song, and even to beauty blind,<br>
Blind to the magic woof that summer weaves,<br>
While roses beat their pearl and ruby leaves<br>
Against my window pane . . .<br>
And orange flowers so passionately white,<br>
So richly perfumed, pined for my delight:<br>
Only my faint heart sighed,<br>
In pity when the glory waned and died,<br>
For all that lovely life unsatisfied!</p>

<p>I was pale and sad in the South like the olive-trees<br>
That droop their silver heads by the dusty roads . . .</p>

<br>
<a name="12"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Spring in the South</p>

<p>Beautiful as some rich embroidery<br>
The valley lies in verdant amplitude,<br>
Great mountains—like old merchants—o'er it brood—<br>
And as a lovely woman languidly<br>
Trailing her long blue robes, so comes the sea<br>
To touch it softly in a wistful mood . . .<br>
The sky forgets her starry multitude,<br>
Seeing how fair mere earthly flowers can be!</p>

<p>Glad country where the wayward feet of Spring,<br>
Moving in mystic dances, bring desire,<br>
New miracles of beauty every day . . .<br>
Where Love and sweet Delight fly wing to wing<br>
Forgetful as in dreams, that bright as fire<br>
So burn the hours of joy as swift away!</p>

<br>
<a name="13"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>&quot;I am Weary, let me Sleep&quot;</p>

<p>I am weary, let me sleep<br>
In some great embroidered bed,<br>
With soft pillows for my head.<br>
I am weary, let me sleep . . .<br>
Petals of sweet roses shed<br>
All around a perfumed heap<br>
White as pearls, and ruby red;<br>
Curtains closely drawn to keep<br>
Wings of darkness o'er me spread . . .<br>
I am weary, let me sleep<br>
In some great embroidered bed.<br>
Let me dream that I am dead,<br>
Nevermore to wake and weep<br>
In the future that I dread . . .<br>
For the ways of life are steep . . .<br>
I am weary, let me sleep . . .</p>

<br>
<a name="14"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Grief</p>

<p>I, that was once so eager for the light,<br>
The vehement pomp and passion of the day,<br>
Am tired at last, and glad to steal away<br>
Across the dusky borders of the night.<br>
The purple darkness now is my delight,<br>
And with great stars my lonely sorrows play,<br>
As still, some proud and tragic princess may<br>
With diamonds make her desolation bright.</p>

<p>Night has become a temple for my tears . . .<br>
The moon a silver shroud for my despair,<br>
And all the golden forests of the spheres<br>
Have showered their splendours on me leaf by leaf<br>
Till men that meet me in the sunlight, stare<br>
To see the shining garment of my grief!</p>

<br>
<a name="15"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Daffodil Dawn</p>

<p>While I slept, and dreamed of you,<br>
Morning, like a princess, came,<br>
All in robe of palest blue:<br>
Stooped and gathered in that hour<br>
From the east a golden flower,<br>
Great and shining flower of flame . . .<br>
Then she hastened on her way<br>
Singing over plain and hill—<br>
While I slept and dreamed of you<br>
Dreams that never can come true . .<br>
Morning at the gates of Day,<br>
Gathered Dawn, the daffodil!</p>

<br>
<a name="16"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Beauty</p>

<p>I saw the face of Beauty—a pale rose<br>
In the gold dusk of her abundant hair . . .<br>
A silken web of dreams and joys—a snare . .<br>
A net of pleasures in a world of woes,<br>
A bright temptation for gay youth that goes<br>
Laughing upon his way without a care!<br>
A shield of light for conquering Love to bear<br>
Stronger than all the swords of all his foes.</p>
<p>O face of Beauty—O white dawn enshrined<br>
In sunrise veils of splendid hair—O star!<br>
Shine on those weary men who sadly wise<br>
But guess thy glory faintly from afar—<br>
Missing the marvel of thy smile—and blind<br>
To the imperial passion in thine eyes!</p>

<br>
<a name="17"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>The Vision</p>

<p>I come from lonely downs and silent woods,<br>
With winter in my heart, a withered world,<br>
A heavy weight of dark and sorrowful things,<br>
And all my dreams spread out their rainbow wings,<br>
And turn again to those bright solitudes<br>
Where Beauty met me in a thousand moods,<br>
And all her shining banners were unfurled . . .<br>
And where I snatched from the sweet hands of Spring<br>
A crystal cup and drank a mystic wine,<br>
And walked alone a secret perfumed way,<br>
And saw the glittering Angels at their play.<br>
And heard the golden birds of Heaven sing,<br>
And woke . . . to find white lilies clustering<br>
And all the emerald wood an empty shrine,<br>
Fragrant with myrrh and frankincense and spice,<br>
And echoing yet the flutes of Paradise . . .</p>

<br>
<a name="18"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>The Dance</p>

<p>Do you remember that day I danced in the woods,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Under the dancing leaves?<br>
Do you remember the delicate blue of the sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the gold-dust in the air?<br>
And the tawny harvest fields, and the heavy sheaves?<br>
Summer was surely in one of her bravest moods . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And oh, the rare<br>
Swift joy that lifted life to an ecstasy,<br>
That shining day I danced for you, dear, in the woods!</p>

<p>The purple twilight came, and the amber moon . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the fairies danced with me . . .<br>
And the shy fauns crept from the tangled thicket near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And the startled dryads bent,<br>
White and starry-eyed, each from her secret tree,<br>
To watch that mystical dance, to share that heavenly swoon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That mad, bright banishment. . . .<br>
For we were free in the perfect country, dear,<br>
When purple twilight came and the amber moon . . .</p>

<p>Some day I shall dance again that mystical dance . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know not when or where!<br>
But the angels shall dance with me, and I shall not be afraid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I shall look in their deep eyes . . .<br>
And feel their arms about me, and their kisses in my hair,<br>
And know that time is over, and the desperate ways of chance. . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I shall be very wise,<br>
And glad at last, and the walls of the world shall fade . . .<br>
The day when I dance again that mystical dance.</p>

<br>

<br>
<br>

<p>The Prisoner of God</p>

<p>Once long and long ago I knew delight.<br>
God gave my spirit wings and a glad voice.<br>
I was a bird that sang at dawn and noon,<br>
That sang at starry evening time and night;<br>
Sang at the sun's great golden doors, and furled<br>
Brave wings in the white gardens of the moon;<br>
That sang and soared beyond the dusty world.</p>

<p>Once long and long ago I did rejoice,<br>
But now I am a stone that falls and falls.<br>
A prisoner, cursing the blank prison walls,<br>
Helpless and dumb, with desperate eyes, that see<br>
The terrible beauty of those simple things<br>
My soul disdained when she was proud and free.<br>
And I can only pray: God pity me,<br>
God pity me and give me back my voice!<br>
God pity me and give me back my wings!</p>

<p>The Storm</p>

<p>What do they hunt to-night, the hounds of the wind?<br>
I think it is joy they hunt, for joy has fled from my heart.<br>
I only remember the hours when I sorrowed or sinned,<br>
I only remember the hours when I stood apart<br>
Lonely and tired, in difficult dreams entranced,<br>
And I forget the days when I loved, and laughed, and danced.</p>

<p>Grey hounds of the wind, I hear your wistful cry,<br>
The cry of unsatisfied hearts hungry for happiness<br>
The house is full of whispering ghosts as you hurry by,<br>
And my soul is heavy and dark with a great distress,<br>
For heaven is far away, and hope is dead;<br>
And the night is a tomb of tears, and despair, and dread.</p>

<p>O hunt no more wild hounds of the wind and rain,<br>
For my soul is afraid of the sound of your hurrying feet,<br>
And surely under the stars a beautiful joy is slain?<br>
Fly! black wings of sorrow . . . wet wings of the night that beat<br>
At the shuttered windows, swiftly fly away,<br>
Before God stoops to gather the golden flower of day.</p>

<p>THE ENGRAVING BY DÜRER</p>

<p>Dürer has drawn him resting by the way . . .<br>
Has he returned from some far pilgrimage?<br>
Or just come out into the light of day<br>
From a dark hermit's cell? We cannot know . . .<br>
With stooping shoulders, and with head bent low<br>
Over his book—and pointed hood drawn down.<br>
His eager eyes devour the printed page . . .<br>
Regardless of the little lovely town<br>
Rising behind him, with its clustered towers . . .<br>
O Saint, look up! and see how gay and fair<br>
The earth is in its summer-time of flowers,<br>
Look up, and see the world, for God is there . . .<br>
Old dreaming Saint, how many are like you,<br>
Intent upon the dusty book of fate:<br>
Slow to discern the false things from the true!<br>
Yet weary of world clamour and world hate,<br>
And hungering for eternal certainties . . .<br>
Not knowing how close about them heaven lies!</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>Black Butterflies</p>

<p>O words of all my songs . . . black butterflies!<br>
Wild words of all the wayward songs I sing . . .<br>
Called from the tomb of some enchanted past<br>
By that strange sphinx, my soul, they slowly rise<br>
And settle on white pages wing to wing . . .<br>
White pages like flower-petals fluttering<br>
Held spellbound there till some blind hour shall bring<br>
The perfect voice that, delicate and wise,<br>
Shall set them free in fairyland at last!<br>
That garden of all dreams and ecstasies<br>
Where my soul sings through an eternal spring,<br>
Watching alone with enigmatic eyes,<br>
Dark wings on pale flower-petals quivering . . .<br>
O words of all my songs . . . black butterflies!</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>In Praise of Youth</p>

<p>O delicate youth, thy praises shall be sung<br>
While yet my heart is young . . .<br>
While Life and I, in search of lovely things,<br>
Go out with dancing feet and dreaming eyes,<br>
And find wild Folly, with her rainbow wings,<br>
Sweeter than all the wisdom of the wise.</p>

<p>O delicate Youth, thy praises shall be sung<br>
While yet my heart is young . . .<br>
Thy whiteness, and thy brightness, and the sweet<br>
Flushed softness of thy little restless feet . . .<br>
The tossed and sunny tangle of thy hair,<br>
Thy swiftness, slimness, shyness, simpleness,<br>
That set the old folk sighing for the rare<br>
Red rose of Joy thy careless days possess.</p>

<p>. . . And when at last, with sad, indifferent face,<br>
I walk in narrow pathways patiently;<br>
Forgetful of thy beauty, and thy truth,<br>
Thy ringing laughter, thy rebellious grace . . .<br>
When fair Love turns his face away from me . . .<br>
Then, let me die, O delicate sweet Youth!</p>

<p>Opal Song</p>

<p>Shy and wild . . . shy and wild<br>
To my lovers I have been.<br>
Frank and wayward as a child,<br>
Strange and secret as a queen;<br>
Fain of love, and love beguiled,<br>
Yet afraid of love, I ween!</p>

<p>False and true . . . false and true<br>
Is the woman's heart in me . . .<br>
Fair lost faces that I rue,<br>
Golden friends I laugh to see,<br>
Changing, I come back to you,<br>
Never doubt my loyalty!</p>

<br>
<a name="25"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Gifts</p>

<p>Come near! you are my friend and I will wear<br>
Gems for your sake, and flowers in my hair;<br>
Garments of silver gauze, and cloth of gold . . .<br>
And I will give you power to have and hold,<br>
And passion, and delight and ecstasy.<br>
What will you give to me?</p>

<p>And I will give you, if you will but stay,<br>
The magic mirror of the dawn, where day<br>
Waking, beholds the wonder of her face—<br>
If you will keep me yet in your embrace,<br>
And let me dream of Love's eternity.<br>
What will you give to me?</p>

<p>Yes! I will give you the gold veils of light,<br>
And the dark spangled curtains of the night . . .<br>
And I will give you as a flower unfurled,<br>
The proud and marvellous beauty of the world,<br>
And all the wild, white horses of the sea.<br>
What will you give to me? . . .</p>

<br>

<p>Primrose Hill</p>

<p>Wild heart in me that frets and grieves,<br>
Imprisoned here against your will . . .<br>
Sad heart that dreams of rainbow wings<br>
See! I have found some golden things!<br>
The poplar trees on Primrose Hill<br>
With all their shining play of leaves . . .<br>
And London like a silver bride,<br>
That will not put her veil aside!</p>

<p>Proud London like a painted Queen,<br>
Whose crown is heavy on her head . . .<br>
City of sorrow and desire,<br>
Under a sky of opal fire,<br>
Amber and amethyst and red . . .<br>
And how divine the day has been!<br>
For every dawn God builds again<br>
This world of beauty and of pain . . .</p>

<p>Wild heart that hungers for delight,<br>
Imprisoned here against your will;<br>
Sad heart, so eager to be gay!<br>
Loving earth's lovely things . . . the play<br>
Of wind and leaves on Primrose Hill . . .<br>
Or London dreaming of the night . . .<br>
Adventurous heart, on beauty bent,<br>
That only Heaven could quite content!</p>

<p>A Morning Song</p>

<p>You saw my window open wide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And woke me early, sister day!<br>
You came in all your lovely pride,<br>
With laughing looks that I adore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With wings of blue and grey . . .<br>
With sunshine skirts that swept the floor,<br>
With songs to drive night's dreams away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You called me out to play.<br>
And so I took you by the hand,<br>
And found the way to fairyland . . .<br>
With such impatient feet I climb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ladders of delight!<br>
For well I know that ruthless time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Turns morning moods to tears and night.</p>

<p>The Wings of Fortune</p>

<p>Fair fortune you are wild and coy,<br>
Fickle, mysterious, and shy . . .<br>
And so we lost you, Love and I!<br>
And now, at last, because we find<br>
Your golden footprints, Love the boy,<br>
Dreams you are near . . . but Love is blind!<br>
Yet, surely Sorrow's arms unwind<br>
From this tired heart, and dark distress<br>
Fades softly . . . softly from the world:<br>
And in Hope's silver sky unfurled,<br>
I see the banners of delight!<br>
And the grey heaven of life grows bright<br>
With the red dawn of happiness . . .<br>
As with a laughing look Love flings<br>
His heavy crown of thorns away . . .<br>
Fair fortune, you are wild and coy,<br>
And ah! I fear you will not stay.<br>
But Love has caught you by the wings<br>
And radiant as Eurydice<br>
By her brave poet's song set free,<br>
I rush into the arms of joy!</p>

<br>

<p>Shadow-Nets</p>

<p>When I was wandering on the Downs to-day<br>
I saw the pine-woods sleeping in the sun . . .<br>
For they were tired of weaving shadow-nets—<br>
Weaving all day in vain . . . in vain . . . in vain . . .<br>
Pale phantom nets to snare the golden sun!<br>
And then I thought of how the poets weave<br>
With shadowy words their cunning nets of song,<br>
Hoping to catch, at last, a shining dream!</p>

<br>
<a name="30"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Peacocks. A Mood</p>

<p>In Gorgeous plumage, azure, gold and green,<br>
They trample the pale flowers, and their shrill cry<br>
Troubles the garden's bright tranquillity!<br>
Proud birds of Beauty, splendid and serene,<br>
Spreading their brilliant fans, screen after screen<br>
Of burnished sapphire, gemmed with mimic suns—<br>
Strange magic eyes, that, so the legend runs,<br>
Will bring misfortune to this fair demesne . . .</p>

<p>And my gay youth, that, vain and debonair,<br>
Sits in the sunshine—tired at last of play<br>
(A child, that finds the morning all too long),<br>
Tempts with its beauty that disastrous day<br>
When in the gathering darkness of despair<br>
Death shall strike dumb the laughing mouth of song.</p>

<br>
<a name="31"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Hyacinthus</p>

<p>Fair boy, how gay the morning must have seemed<br>
Before the fatal game that murdered thee!<br>
Of such a dawn my wistful heart has dreamed:<br>
Surely I too have lived in Arcady<br>
When Spring, lap-full of roses, ran to meet<br>
White Aphrodite risen from the sea . . .</p>

<p>Perchance I saw thee then, so glad and fleet;<br>
Hasten to greet Apollo, stoop to bind<br>
The gold and jewelled sandals on his feet,<br>
While he so radiant, so divinely kind,<br>
Lured thee with honeyed words to be his friend,<br>
All heedless of thy fate, for Love is blind.</p>

<p>For Love is blind and cruel, and the end<br>
Of every joy is sorrow and distress.<br>
And when immortal creatures lightly bend<br>
To kiss the lips of simple loveliness,<br>
Swords are unsheathed in silence, and clouds rise,<br>
Some God is jealous of the mute caress . . .</p>

<p>But who shall mourn thy death—ah, not the wise?<br>
Better to perish in thy happiest hour,<br>
To close in sight of beauty thy dark eyes,<br>
And, dying so, be changed into a flower,<br>
Than that the stealthy and relentless years<br>
Should steal that grace which was thy only dower.</p>

<p>And bring thee in return dull cares and tears,<br>
And difficult days and sickness and despair . . .<br>
O, not for thee the griefs and sordid fears<br>
That, like a burden, trembling age must bear;<br>
Slain in thy youth, by the sweet hands of Love,<br>
Thou shalt remain for ever young and fair . . .</p>

<br>

<p>Hylas</p>

<p>Dark boy, how radiantly you went to meet<br>
Your mystic doom . . . what colours in the sky!<br>
As though that cup of beauty the gods hold<br>
Brimmed over on a world in ecstasy . . .<br>
What silver flutes charmed all the forest ways . . .<br>
How the green shimmered, jewelled thick with flowers,<br>
And how the sun was like a globe of gold . . .<br>
Yet you but thought to chase the perfect hours<br>
Down that white road of wonder and delight,<br>
The highway of your dreams, and heedlessly<br>
You crushed the violets with your slim brown feet,<br>
And whistled low, and sang a careless song . . .<br>
Because your life was full of lovely days,<br>
Because your life was delicate and sweet . . .<br>
O youth and dawn . . . you dreamed not of the night . . .<br>
O life and laughter . . . but the night is long . . .</p>

<br>
<a name="33"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Blue Flowers</p>

<p>I go to gather in the woods for you<br>
The wild flowers that are blue . . .<br>
Petals to match the colour of your eyes!</p>
<p>None but blue blossoms will I take, yet see<br>
How sweetly tempting me<br>
The fruit trees swing their scented treasuries.</p>

<p>And how the buttercups and daisies dance<br>
To meet my dazzled glance!<br>
But gold and silver, Sweet, are naught to you.</p>
<p>And so let others rob God's gardens . . . shake<br>
The stars down for your sake—<br>
I bring you but the wild flowers that are blue!</p>

<br>

<br>
<br>

<p>Madrigal</p>

<p>Rare garden where my heart goes gathering<br>
Many a lovely and delightful thing,<br>
Pale roses of your body and the fair<br>
Unrivalled yellow blossoms of your hair!</p>

<p>Tall lilies of your gay and careless grace,<br>
And O the wistful flower of your face!<br>
And all the soft and starry mysteries<br>
Of those divine forget-me-nots, your eyes . . .</p>

<p>O come, fair Love, before the flowers fade,<br>
And bless this garden that the gods have made . . . <br>
Rare garden where my heart goes gathering<br>
Many a lovely and delightful thing . . .</p>

<p>Endymion</p>

<p>Your hair was like a honey-coloured flame<br>
Seen through a veil of silver when you came<br>
And took me in your arms that winter night . . .<br>
The moonlight, amorous of your golden hair,<br>
Toyed with it softly, as a woman might<br>
With some bright treasure, delicate and rare.</p>

<p>O, young Endymion, risen from the dead,<br>
Born once again to beauty, O bright head!<br>
The moon stoops low to kiss you, as of old;<br>
Stoops graciously from her great throne of pearl,<br>
With outstretched arms mysterious and cold . . .<br>
But you have left her for a mortal girl.</p>

<br>
<a name="36"></a>
<br>
<br>

<p>Dance Song</p>

<p>O hide your passion from the moon.<br>
When young and slender she appears<br>
In shining gown and silver shoon . . .<br>
And, all her path with stars impearled,<br>
She dances round the darkened world.</p>

<p>O hide your sorrows from the sun . . .<br>
The sun should never see your tears!<br>
Weep, if you will, when day is done . . .<br>
But laugh and sing and clap your hands<br>
While yet the sun in heaven stands.</p>

<p>A Memory</p>

<p>O how I loved you when we met<br>
For that one moment of the day!<br>
Yes, loved you desperately, and yet<br>
Could scarcely find a word to say—<br>
No wonder that you looked and smiled<br>
As though upon some timid child.<br>
You never guessed, how could you guess<br>
That I adored your loveliness!</p>

<p>You never saw the prisoned soul<br>
Behind the windows of my eyes,<br>
Frantic to break from fate's control<br>
And charm you with her flatteries . . .<br>
And show you, your cold heart to move,<br>
The shining treasure of her love,<br>
And worship in a long embrace,<br>
The reckless beauty of your face!</p>

<p>You never knew . . . and the dream died<br>
A broken rose beneath your feet . . .<br>
You went your way . . . the world is wide<br>
And I forgot, for youth is sweet . . .<br>
Yet when at night I lie awake,<br>
My heart is sad for a dream's sake,<br>
And I remember and regret . . .<br>
O how I loved you when we met!</p>

<br>

<p>The Photograph</p>

<p>O Beauty, what is this?<br>
A shadow of your face . . .<br>
Where is the wild flower grace<br>
That Love is wont to kiss?</p>

<p>Where is the bird that brings<br>
To your untroubled eyes<br>
The blue of fairy skies,<br>
The flash of fairy wings? . . .</p>

<p>O wild bird of delight,<br>
That no white hand may hold,<br>
Or fairest cage of gold . . .<br>
For who would stay its flight?</p>

<p>The song-bird of your voice<br>
Whose magic song Love hears,<br>
Trembling behind your tears,<br>
Trilling when you rejoice . . .</p>

<p>O Beauty, what is this?<br>
The shadow of a rose . . .<br>
A little ghost that goes<br>
Oblivious of Love's kiss.</p>

<p>Only a shadow . . . yet<br>
It may, in some dark hour<br>
Recall the living flower . . .<br>
If haply Love forget.</p>

<p>St. Sebastian</p>

<p>So beautiful in all thine agony!<br>
So radiant in thine infinite despair . . .<br>
Oh, delicate mouth, brave eyes, and curled bright hair . . .<br>
Oh, lovely body lashed to the rough tree:<br>
What brutal fools were those that gave to thee<br>
Red roses of thine outraged blood to wear,<br>
Laughed at thy bitter pain and loathed the fair<br>
Bruised flower of thy victorious purity?</p>

<p>Marvellous Beauty . . . target of the world,<br>
How all Love's arrows seek thy joy, Oh Sweet!<br>
And wound the white perfection of thy youth!<br>
How all the poisoned spears of hate are hurled<br>
Against thy sorrow when thou darest to meet<br>
With martyrdom men's mockery of the truth!</p>

<p>The Magic Mirrors</p>

<p>In the dim mirrors of imagination,<br>
I watch the silent dancing of my soul . . .<br>
I watch her as she dances with my dreams . . .<br>
See how she takes innumerable disguises,<br>
And hides her beauty behind many masks,<br>
And how, sometimes, she seems to laugh and sing,<br>
. . . And weep . . . and call upon the unknown Gods . . .<br>
But not one mirror has betrayed her voice,<br>
Or shown to me the secret of her face . . .<br>
O silent dance of sorrow and delight,<br>
My heart grown tired with watching, turns away,<br>
To make perhaps a little passionate song<br>
Out of the shadows of immortal things . . .</p>
